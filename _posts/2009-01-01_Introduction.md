As I'm sure many are doing given the current state of the economy my wife & I have made the decision to tighten our belts financially. This ultimately led to the setup of this blog as we looked for new family activities to enjoy.  
  
My wife is a keen amateur photographer, while I have always enjoyed contributing to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_page) in my spare time (what little there is of it! :-)). We also both enjoy traveling and seeing new & different places.   
  
There are over [1,100 Wikipedia pages related to Iowa cities & towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_requested_photographs_in_Iowa) for which photographs have been requested. From this the idea came that we could travel to these places and document them visually, using the best photographs to enhance each Wikipedia article. Not only will this get us out of the house and discovering something new about the state we live in each week but is also fairly low cost. Sunday seemed to be the best fit, and so our plan was set.  
  
We hope you enjoy following along on our journey as we look to provide interesting and unique views of Iowa in the 21st Century!
